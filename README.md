# Social Network API Simulation        
This exercise is our cohort's 18th weekly challenge, centering on creating a functional API with a NoSQL back end.
The functionality of this app is meant largely for academic purposes to simulate the back-end of a social media application; there is no front end in this exercise, manipulation of the database is done entirely via Insomnia.

## Installation
Two NPM packages are specified for this application: Express and Mongoose. These can be installed from the command line with `npm i` or `npm install`. Once that is completed, run `npm start` and open up Insomnia to localhost:3001. <br>Enjoy!

## Usage
There are four main components of this API: Users, Reactions, Thoughts, and Friends. Each of these is designed to work similar to most social media platforms: friends can be added or removed; thoughts can be added, edited, or removed; reactions to thoughts can be created or deleted.
